## Predicting First-Time Airbnb User Bookings (Python)

This Project was aimed at predicting where a new Airbnb user will book thier first travel experience. We cleaned the datasets in the Kaggle competition found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings) and implemented various models. We analyzed our models by using cross validation and calculating the various accuracies.
